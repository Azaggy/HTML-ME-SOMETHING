        <h4>Posso E Lo Faro Guardami</h4>
            <p>This tattoo is in Italian. It translates to "I can, and I will. Watch Me." As you can see the first O in Posso is changed into a semicolon. It is my version of the popular semicolon tattoos that a number of people got as a form of solidarity between people dealing with mental illness or the death of someone from suicide. I got this tattoo because I struggle with mental illness. It reminds me that even when I am feeling down I can make it through this and my story shouldn't end.  </p>
        <h4>Stay Gold, Ponyboy</h4>
            <p>Anyone who has read the book 'The Outsiders' knows that this is the last thing Johnny told Ponyboy before he passed away. It is in relation to Robert Frost's poem "Nothing Gold Can Stay". Ever since I read the book in middle school the poem has stuck with me. Johnny's last words also stuck with me. My interpretation of the poem is that everyone has an innocence or niceness in them, but over time in this world that innocence fades away until it is gone. So, I think that what Johnny is trying to say to Ponyboy is that he should hold on to that innocence for as long as he can and to keep his head up.</p>
