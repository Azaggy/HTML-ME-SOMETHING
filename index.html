        <h1>The Meaning Behind My Tattoos</h1>
        <h3>Created by Anamaria Zaggy</h3>
        <h4>Posso E Lo Faro Guardami</h4>
            <p>This tattoo is in Italian. It translates to "I can, and I will. Watch Me." As you can see the first O in Posso is changed into a semicolon. It is my version of the popular semicolon tattoos that a number of people got as a form of solidarity between people dealing with mental illness or the death of someone from suicide. I got this tattoo because I struggle with mental illness. It reminds me that even when I am feeling down I can make it through this and my story shouldn't end.  </p>
        <h4>Stay Gold, Ponyboy</h4>
            <p>Anyone who has read the book 'The Outsiders' knows that this is the last thing Johnny told Ponyboy before he passed away. It is in relation to Robert Frost's poem "Nothing Gold Can Stay". Ever since I read the book in middle school the poem has stuck with me. Johnny's last words also stuck with me. My interpretation of the poem is that everyone has an innocence or niceness in them, but over time in this world that innocence fades away until it is gone. So, I think that what Johnny is trying to say to Ponyboy is that he should hold on to that innocence for as long as he can and to keep his head up.</p>
        <h4>La Vita E Belle. Goditi Tutto</h4>
            <p>This tattoo is also in Italian. It translates to "The life is beautiful. Enjoy it all." I got the first part of this tattoo back when I was 17. Back then I was struggling with my depression and self-harm impulses, so having this on my arm at that time was very important to me. I later added the second part, because I had finally gotten a hold of my self-harm impulses. Now it helps me to remember to enjoy the life that I have been given. </p>
        <h4>Van Gogh Quote</h4>
            <p>It is said that Vincent Van Gogh said, "Art is to console those who are broken by life." Art has always been a big part of my life. It allows me to express my emotions on paper rather then to hold it in. So it goes to show that I would get this tattooed on me because it resonates with me. It also made it better that Van Gogh said it because I have always been fond of his art and his life. He created beautiful pieces of art, even when his mental health was not the best. He also kept painting even when no one would buy his art. </p>
        <h4>Quintzel and White Nun Orchid</h4>
            <p>I was adopted from Guatemala when I was only 4 months old. Growing up, I would always try to learn about my heritage. When I was about 10 I learned that the national bird and flower was the Quintzel and the White Nun Orchid. Ever since then I have wanted to get something that will remind me of where I came from. At first, I wanted to get something that relates to the Mayan Indians since I am an desendent of them, but about two years ago I had created a piece of art involving the Quintzel and White Nun Orchid and loved the how it turned out so I decided to get it tattooed instead. </p>
