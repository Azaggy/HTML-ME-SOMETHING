        <h4>Posso E Lo Faro Guardami</h4>
            <p>This tattoo is in Italian. It translates to "I can, and I will. Watch Me." As you can see the first O in Posso is changed into a semicolon. It is my version of the popular semicolon tattoos that a number of people got as a form of solidarity between people dealing with mental illness or the death of someone from suicide. I got this tattoo because I struggle with mental illness. It reminds me that even when I am feeling down I can make it through this and my story shouldn't end.  </p>
