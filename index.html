                    <h2>Posso E Lo Faro Guardami</h2>
                    <p>
                        This tattoo is in Italian. It translates to "I can, and I will.
                         Watch Me." As you can see the first O in Posso is changed into 
                         a semicolon. It is my version of the popular semicolon tattoos 
                         that a number of people got as a form of solidarity between 
                         people dealing with mental illness or the death of someone from 
                         suicide. I got this tattoo because I struggle with mental 
                         illness. It reminds me that even when I am feeling down I can 
                         make it through this and my story shouldn't end.

                    <h2>Stay Gold, Ponyboy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Anyone who has read the book 'The Outsiders' knows that this is the 
                        last thing Johnny told Ponyboy before he passed away. It is in 
                        relation to Robert Frost's poem "Nothing Gold Can Stay". Ever since 
                        I read the book in middle school the poem has stuck with me. Johnny's 
                        last words also stuck with me. My interpretation of the poem is that 
                        everyone has an innocence or niceness in them, but over time in this 
                        world that innocence fades away until it is gone. So, I think that 
                        what Johnny is trying to say to Ponyboy is that he should hold on to 
                        that innocence for as long as he can and to keep his head up.

                    <h2>La Vita E Belle. Goditi Tutto</h2>
                    <p>
                        This tattoo is also in Italian. It translates to "The life is 
                        beautiful. Enjoy it all." I got the first part of this tattoo back
                        when I was 17. Back then I was struggling with my depression and 
                        self-harm impulses, so having this on my arm at that time was very 
                        important to me. I later added the second part, because I had 
                        finally gotten a hold of my self-harm impulses. Now it helps me to 
                        remember to enjoy the life that I have been given.

                    <h2>Van Gogh Quote</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is said that Vincent Van Gogh said, "Art is 
                        to console those who are broken by life." Art has 
                        always been a big part of my life. It allows me to 
                        express my emotions on paper rather then to hold it
                         in. So it goes to show that I would get this 
                         tattooed on me because it resonates with me. It also
                          made it better that Van Gogh said it because I have 
                          always been fond of his art and his life. He created 
                          beautiful pieces of art, even when his mental health 
                          was not the best. He also kept painting even when no 
                          one would buy his art.

                    <h2>Quintzel and White Nun Orchid</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was adopted from Guatemala when I was only 4 months old. Growing up, 
                        I would always try to learn about my heritage. When I was about 10 I 
                        learned that the national bird and flower was the Quintzel and the White 
                        Nun Orchid. Ever since then I have wanted to get something that will 
                        remind me of where I came from. At first, I wanted to get something that 
                        relates to the Mayan Indians since I am an desendent of them, but about two 
                        years ago I had created a piece of art involving the Quintzel and White Nun 
                        Orchid and loved the how it turned out so I decided to get it tattooed instead.
